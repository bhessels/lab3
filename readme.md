the covid rate per county show the largest percentages of covid cases per population taking place in the center and the northern midwest. the reason for a higher percentage is because many counties in the internal U.S. have small populations making the percentage of the population being effected seem much larger.

for the number of covid cases we see that the largest bubbles take place near the cost and in the eastern part of the U.S. this is because these areas are very densly populated and are the reason their are more individual covid cases overall.
